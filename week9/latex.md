This week we pay tribute to the eminent geneticist Richard Lewontin, well known for making use of gel electrophoresis technique to study genetic variation in organisms. Lewontin passed away earlier this month.  Below are some interesting links if you wish to read more:

## Data for this week

The video tutorial for this week is self explanatory so I will refrain from providing text prompts for all steps. Please follow the video recording using following data.

- Inside ``week9`` folder, there is a ``data`` folder, which contains following items:

	- ``lewontin.txt`` is a text file containing a 1966 paper by Lewontin and Hubby

	- ``droso.jpg`` is a figure that you will insert in the resulting pdf document

	- ``references.txt`` contains all references from the article.

	- ``table.png`` is a screenshot of Table 3 from the article. You will learn to manually typeset this table.

## Further reading on LaTeX

If you are curious about the development of LaTeX, here are some important people who were seminal in its develpment and some associated articles:

- [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport) and [his book](https://www.amazon.com/LaTeX-Document-Preparation-System-2nd/dp/0201529831)

- Donald Knuth's profile in New York Times: [The Yoda of Silicon Valley](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/science/donald-knuth-computers-algorithms-programming.html) 

- <span style="color:blue">One of the beginner's guide to LaTeX that has been around for over 25 years is still an extremely useful first book (free of course):</span>
	
	- [The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX by Oetiker, Partl, Hyna and Schlegl](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf).  **I highly recommend it**.
