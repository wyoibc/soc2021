**Note**: This document is currently incomplete. An update will be posted later this week. Currently, use this as a framework together with instructions provided during the zoom session.


1. Create a github repository called ``covid_prisons``

2. Create a local folder called ``covid_prisons`` inside ``~/Github`` on your computer

3. Load prisons data into R using tidyverse functions

4. Follow instructions on zoom for preparing a report using following questions:

	- Print summary of the prisons tibble to the report
	
	- Draw a map of prison locations across the United States and print it on report

	- Remove data for all states except for your home state and print it on report

	- For your home state, adjust the size of the points scaled to the size of prison population

	- For your home state, plot the number of covid cases on the map and again scale point size according to data

5. Write a summary of your findings in the report.

6. Compile your report from ``.md`` to ``.html`` using ``pandoc`` document converter you installed earlier.

7. Push your changes upstream to your repository.

8. Publish your github repository as a html website.
